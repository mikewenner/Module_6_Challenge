# Module_6_Challenge
***
## This is the data visualization module challenge that examines the San Francisco real estate market in an effort to discern if a one-click buy and rent strategy is viable.
***
## The deliverable for this project is the Jupyter Notebook file entitled san_francisco_housing.ipynb and is found in the data folder of this repository. The notebook utilizes hvplot for interactive plots.  To visualize and interact with the plots please run the code cells in a Jupyter Notebook or equivalent.  
***
## For reference and if one cannot run code and access interactive plotting, the images folder contains still grabs in .png format of the plots generated in project.
